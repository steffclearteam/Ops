How this happened - 
Steff Browne's Metamask wallet is 0x3A8Af31D3cFE775172853528167bb2b5760bf7b9. This wallet is connected to Alchemy, was to submit the activation challenge and received the first payout for the activation proposal.

Unfortunately, when Steff initially filled out the dOrg activation challenge sign-up form (before understanding that future payments would be in xDAI) she entered  an older ETH address to a Bitcoin account on Coinbase: 0x64FD9565262B1FB04C956013Dac1E0Ae4E98FE8E. That form entry was copied to the dOrg Airtable. 

The most recent payouts were sent to the Bitcoin wallet. Steff does not have the keys to Coinbase wallet and although she filed a support issue with Coinbase support to get the transactions sent back if at possible, it appears at this time the funds are likely irretrievable.

This DSP is to replace the lost payments.
